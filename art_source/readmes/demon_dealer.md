# Forbidden demon-contract broker (Depth 6)

A restrained, unsettling, human-looking negotiator rather than a horned demon. Slicked dark hair, pale greyish skin with **dark-red eye pixels** (the only tell), a long black-red coat with dull gold fastenings over a dark shirt, black gloves, trousers and shoes. No weapon. Use `Idle2` and `Taunt` for the offer.

## Sheet format (same for every PNG)
- **1920 x 1024 px**, transparent background: **15 columns x 8 rows** of **128 x 128 px** frames. Every animation uses all 15 frames.
- **Each row is one direction:**

| Row | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Faces | E (right) | SE | S (toward camera) | SW | W (left) | NW | N (away) | NE |

- Characters stand about 45 px tall inside the frame. **No drop shadow** is baked in: draw your own in the engine. Use point/nearest filtering, no mipmaps.

## The 30 animations (same names for every character)

| dodge / roll | `Rolling` (`Slide` also works) |

| hurt | `TakeDamage` |
| death / defeated | `Die` (hold the last frame) |
| victory / taunt / gesture | `Taunt` |
